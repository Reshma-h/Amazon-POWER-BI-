# Amazon-POWER-BI-
Created a Dashboard by using  different visuals 
In this project, we will be using Power BI to analyze product data scraped from
Amazon's website using Selenium. We will perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and
exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data. We will
also create interactive visualizations to present our findings and gain insights.
